et's create a view called EMPSALARY to display salary along with some basic sensitive data of employees from the HR database.

CREATE VIEW EMPSALARY AS
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES;


SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;

Assume that the EMPSALARY view we created in Task 1 doesn't contain enough salary information, such as max/min salary and the job title of the employees. For this, we need to get information from other tables in the database. You need all columns from EMPLOYEES table used above, except for SALARY.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMPSALARY AS
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, JOB_TITLE,
MIN_SALARY, MAX_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES, JOBS
WHERE EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_IDENT;

SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;

#PARA BORRAR
DROP VIEW EMPSALARY;

PRACTICE

CREATE VIEW EMP_DEPT AS
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES;

#modify
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMP_DEPT AS
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS
WHERE EMPLOYEES.DEP_ID = DEPARTMENTS.DEPT_ID_DEP;

DROP VIEW EMPSALARY;
