Write a query that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
SELECT SUM(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;

SELECT SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST FROM PETRESCUE;

For this query, we will use the function MAX(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the maximum value of all elements in the column. The query for this question can be written as:

SELECT MAX(QUANTITY) FROM PETRESCUE;

SELECT MIN(QUANTITY) FROM PETRESCUE;

Write a query that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
SELECT AVG(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;

Write a query that displays the rounded integral cost of each rescue.
SELECT ROUND(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;
o
SELECT ROUND(COST, 0) FROM PETRESCUE;

despues de la coma se pone la cantidad de decimales

Write a query that displays the length of each animal name.

SELECT LENGTH(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;

Write a query that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
SELECT UCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;

Just as easily, the user could ask for a lower case representation, and the query would be changed to:
SELECT LCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;

FECHAS

Write a query that displays the rescue date.
SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;


SELECT MONTH(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;


SELECT YEAR(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;

Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrival. Write a query that displays the third day of each rescue.

SELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE

SELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 2 MONTH) FROM PETRESCUE

SELECT DATE_SUB(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE

Write a query that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued, for example, the difference between the current date and the rescue date.
SELECT DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE

SELECT FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE)) FROM PETRESCUE
