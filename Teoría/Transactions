Scenario: Rose is buying a pair of boots from ShoeShop. So we have to update Rose's balance as well as the ShoeShop balance in the BankAccounts table. Then we also have to update Boots stock in the ShoeShop table. After Boots, let's also attempt to buy Rose a pair of Trainers.

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE TRANSACTION_ROSE()
BEGIN
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        ROLLBACK;
        RESIGNAL;
    END;
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE BankAccounts
    SET Balance = Balance-200
    WHERE AccountName = 'Rose';

    UPDATE BankAccounts
    SET Balance = Balance+200
    WHERE AccountName = 'Shoe Shop';

    UPDATE ShoeShop
    SET Stock = Stock-1
    WHERE Product = 'Boots';

    UPDATE BankAccounts
    SET Balance = Balance-300
    WHERE AccountName = 'Rose';

    COMMIT;
END //

DELIMITER ;
