This RETRIEVE_ALL routine will contain an SQL query to retrieve all the records from the PETSALE table, so you don't need to write the same query over and over again. You just call the stored procedure routine to execute the query everytime.
To create the stored procedure routine, copy the code below and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. Click Go.

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE RETRIEVE_ALL()
BEGIN
   SELECT *  FROM PETSALE;
END //
DELIMITER ;
