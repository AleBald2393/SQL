SELECT statement usage
SELECT is classified as a Database Query command used to retrieve information from a database table.

There are various forms in which a SELECT statement is used.

The general syntax of a SELECT statement retrieves the data under the listed columns from Table_1. The code is:

SELECT COLUMN1, COLUMN2, ... FROM TABLE_1 ;

2. To retrieve all columns from a table, use " * " instead of specifying individual column names. The code below retrieves the entire table.
SELECT * FROM TABLE_1 ;

3.Use the WHERE clause to filter the required data based on a predicate. The code below filters the response to only the entries that match the predicate.

SELECT <COLUMNS> FROM TABLE_1 WHERE <predicate> ;
