SQL JOIN is a clause that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
The table's relationship is established by comparing the values in the columns. 
The purpose of using JOINs is to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query. 
There are four types of JOINs in SQL: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows with matching values in both tables.

LEFT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

RIGHT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all the rows when a match in the left or right table.
